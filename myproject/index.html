        <h2>üìú How am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am frontend focused fullstack web developer, mobile applications developer and software engineer with a zeal and burning desire for all things tech. My deeply rooted enthusiasm for technology started back in high school when I wrote my first ever Hello World program with C++.
          <br>
          Through trial and error and a lot of hands-on work I finally decide to further polish my skill in web development due to it's dynamic and volatile nature. Ever since I have built various projects with intuitive UI providing a seemless user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from Web Development, I am also a soccer fan. I was fortunate enough to contribute to my middle school's success for winning back to back tournaments serving as the captain for 3 years straight. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Last but not least, I am equally passionate about reading and listening to music. My favorite artist is Elizabeth Grant (Aka Lana Del Rey). I will glady like to talk more about erstwhile topics.
